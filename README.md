# PTIT
My place to upload code
This is my personal code, it is not the most effective code, but it works :))

If you need help with my solution, you can contact me at Telegram:
###    http://t.me/ChauBacHo    ####

Also notice the prefix before every commit:
[WA] - Wrong Answer
[TLE] - Time Limit exceeded
if not have any prefix then that code is AC - Accepted

Ex: (commit) [TLE] - HashMap II --> This code got Timelimit exceeded
Ex: (commit) 2 HashMap --> This words

You can search on Google the name of the files.

I don't think that no one ever visit this git anyway :(
